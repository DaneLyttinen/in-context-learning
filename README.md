# General-Purpose In-Context Learning by Meta-Learning Transformers *(paper reproduction)*

This repository contains code that attempts to reproduce the results of the paper [**General-Purpose In-Context Learning by Meta-Learning Transformers**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04458.pdf) in PyTorch. The most important pieces of code can be found in `explore.ipynb`.

In short, I couldn't get over the memorization to the point of *phase transition* in the model's generalization ability as was shown in Figure 4 of the paper. Given the computational burden of the number of tasks, I discontinued experiments but hope to get back to this later.
